AdsYolo-Kershik
===============

This repository contains the source code for the AdsYolo 'Kershik' Android app.

#Requirements
1. This application requires ABS (Action Bar Sherlock) for Android 4.1 HOLO theme
2. Add the .jar files in root directory to the libraries (both load and compile libs)

## Building

The build requires [Action Bar Sherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/)
v4.3.0+ and the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
to be installed in your development environment.

You might find that your device doesn't let you install your build if you
already have the version from the Android Market installed.  This is standard
Android security as it it won't let you directly replace an app that's been
signed with a different key.  Manually uninstall the app from your device and
you will then be able to install your own built version.
